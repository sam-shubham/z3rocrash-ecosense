Tech Stack
â€¢ Frontend:
â€¢ React.js (Responsive UI with Material-UI for components)
â€¢ CSS-in-JS for custom styling
â€¢ Backend:
â€¢ Node.js
â€¢ Express.js
â€¢ Socket.IO for real-time AI chatbot interactions
â€¢ APIs:
â€¢ Weather API for forecasting and AQI data.
â€¢ OpenAI API for AI assistance.
â€¢ Database: MongoDB (for storing user preferences and chat history)
â€¢ Deployment: Dockerized setup (scalable and platform-independent)

Setup Process 
### 1. Clone the Repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/username/ecosense.git
cd ecosense
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables:
#### Create a .env file in the root directory.
#### Add the following:

```console
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=9090
```

### 4. Run the Project:

```console
npm run dev
```
### 5. Access the Application:
    Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Future Expansion 
1. Product Recommendations:
    â€¢ Integrate OpenFoodFacts API for product sustainability data.
    â€¢ Add recyclability scoring using Material AI.
2. User Profiles:
    â€¢ Track and display user-specific sustainability progress over time.
3. Gamification:
    â€¢ Introduce badges and rewards for sustainable actions.
4. Mobile App:
    â€¢ Develop a React Native app for better accessibility.
5. Carbon Offset Integration:
    â€¢ Partner with carbon offset programs to allow users to directly contribute to environmental initiatives.

How It Works 
1. Weather & AQI Data:
â€¢ The app fetches real-time weather and air quality data using the Weather API based on the userâ€™s geolocation.
2. AI Chatbot:
â€¢ Socket.IO ensures seamless communication between the user and the AI.
â€¢ The chatbot understands current weather and provides relevant sustainability tips (e.g., energy-saving tips during high energy usage days).
3. Sustainability Scores:
â€¢ Metrics are calculated using API integrations and algorithms to assess energy consumption, water usage, and carbon footprint.
